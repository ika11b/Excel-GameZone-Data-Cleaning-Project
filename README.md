# Excel-GameZone-Data-Cleaning-Project

Welcome to the Excel GameZone Data Cleaning Project Repository

The main objective of this project is to clean, validate, and enhance a raw GameZone dataset using Excel. The dataset contains customer purchase data, and the cleaning process focused on identifying and resolving common data quality issues to prepare the dataset for future analysis.

During this project, I applied the following Excel skills:

• Data Cleaning (fixing inconsistent date formats, handling missing values, and removing duplicates)
• Data Validation (flagging invalid transactions like shipping before purchase)
• Data Enrichment (creating new columns such as Purchase Year, Month, and Time to Ship)
• Logical Functions (using IF and other formulas to standardize and clean values)
• Project Documentation (clearly tracking all issues, actions taken, and formulas used for full transparency and reproducibility)
